- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @taraippolito

I'm a computational scientist with extensive experience using advanced analytical methods to explore environmental and agronomic problems. I am particularly adept at leveraging publicly available data to answer questions in data scarce settings and parsing scientific literature to find novel methodologies from a variety of domains. I currently work as a postdoc on the Global Soil Health Team at Syngenta Group where I build science-based analytical tools in collaboration with internal and external partners to support agronomic and soil health outcomes.
