- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @taraippolito

I am a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow getting my PhD at University of Colorado Boulder in Environmental Studies. 
I work on estimating and assessing how soil and climate uniquely interact to drive agricultural outcomes and using these insights to identify pathways for improving yields and soil health. Drop me a line if you're interested in my work or have any questions.
